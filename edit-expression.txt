Hello sir.

I am new to web development / software engineering.


When I was trying your API, I noticed a spelling error(unwanted apostrophe) on Anne Frank's inspiring expression.
You can see it here: https://api.fisenko.net/v1/quotes/en/6153bbb29e8e5ae3eb239825


You created something wonderful. I want to make it 'perfect'.

Sorry if I do not know how to make a proper pull request for a project.

Have a great day!
